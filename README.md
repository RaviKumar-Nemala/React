# React Programs and Practices

Welcome to the React Programs and Practices repository! This repository contains a collection of React projects and practices that cover various aspects of React development. Whether you're looking to learn about state management, components, reusable tables, Redux, async thunks, or Redux Toolkit Query, you'll find valuable examples and resources here.

## Projects and Practices

### 1. State Management

- Explore different state management techniques, including:
  - **React useState**: Examples demonstrating basic state management using the `useState` hook.
  - **Context API**: Learn how to use React's Context API for managing global state.
  - **MobX**: Understand how MobX can simplify state management in your React applications.

### 2. Components

- Discover best practices for creating and structuring React components.
- Explore reusable component patterns to enhance code reusability and maintainability.

### 3. Reusable Tables

### 5. Async Thunks

- Explore asynchronous operations in Redux using Redux Thunk middleware.
- Learn how to handle data fetching, asynchronous actions, and side effects in your Redux applications.

### 6. Redux Toolkit Query

- Discover the power of Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) for simplifying API data fetching and caching.
- Learn how to set up RTK Query and use it to fetch and manage data in your React applications.
